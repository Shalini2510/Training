Assignment 1: Pseudocode Development - Task: Write a detailed pseudocode for a simple program that takes a number as input, calculates the square if it's even or the cube if it's odd, and then outputs the result. Incorporate conditional and looping constructs.


1. Start

2. Prompt the user to enter a number and store it in a variable num.

3. If num is not a valid number (i.e., not an integer), display an error message and terminate the program.

4. Check if num is even or odd:
   a. If num % 2 equals 0:
      - Set result = num * num  // Calculate the square of num
      - Display "The square of {num} is {result}."
   b. Else:
      - Set result = num * num * num  // Calculate the cube of num
      - Display "The cube of {num} is {result}."

5. End
